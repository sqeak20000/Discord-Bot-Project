# Discord to Guilded Cross-Posting Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automatic cross-posting from a Discord updates channel to a Roblox Guilded server announcements channel.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

1. **Discord Bot** - Your existing Discord bot (already configured)
2. **Guilded Bot** - You'll need to create a bot on Guilded
3. **Channel IDs** - Discord updates channel and Guilded announcements channel

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a Guilded Bot

1. Go to [Guilded Developer Portal](https://www.guilded.gg/developers/applications)
2. Click "Create Application"
3. Fill in your bot's name and description
4. Go to the "Bot" section
5. Copy the **Bot Token** (you'll need this for your .env file)

### 2. Add Bot to Your Guilded Server

1. In the Guilded Developer Portal, go to your bot's page
2. Go to "OAuth2" â†’ "URL Generator"
3. Select the scopes and permissions your bot needs:
   - `bot` scope
   - `Send Messages` permission
   - `Manage Messages` permission (optional, for better functionality)
4. Copy the generated URL and visit it
5. Select your Guilded server and authorize the bot

### 3. Get Required IDs

#### Discord Updates Channel ID:
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings â†’ Advanced â†’ Developer Mode)
2. Right-click on your updates channel â†’ "Copy ID"

#### Guilded Server ID:
1. In Guilded, right-click on your server name â†’ "Copy Server ID"

#### Guilded Announcements Channel ID:
1. In Guilded, right-click on your announcements channel â†’ "Copy Channel ID"

### 4. Update Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Existing Discord bot token
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# New cross-posting configuration
DISCORD_UPDATES_CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id_here
GUILDED_BOT_TOKEN=your_guilded_bot_token_here
GUILDED_SERVER_ID=your_guilded_server_id_here
GUILDED_ANNOUNCEMENTS_CHANNEL_ID=your_guilded_channel_id_here
```

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Test the Setup

1. Start your bot: `python Main.py`
2. In any Discord channel (as a moderator), run: `!testcrosspost`
3. Check your Guilded announcements channel for the test message

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### Automatic Cross-Posting
- **Monitors:** Your specified Discord updates channel
- **Action:** When a message is posted in that channel, it automatically cross-posts to Guilded
- **Format:** Includes author attribution, content, embeds, and attachment links
- **Feedback:** Adds âœ… reaction to successfully cross-posted messages

### Manual Testing
- **Command:** `!testcrosspost` (moderators only)
- **Purpose:** Test that cross-posting is working correctly
- **Output:** Sends a test message to Guilded and confirms success/failure

## ðŸ“± Message Format

When a Discord message is cross-posted to Guilded, it includes:

```
ðŸ“¢ Update from Discord (by Username)

[Original message content]

ðŸ“Ž Attachments:
1. [filename.png](attachment_url)
2. [document.pdf](attachment_url)
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Cross-posting not working?
1. Check that ALL environment variables are set in your `.env` file
2. Verify your Guilded bot has permissions to send messages in the announcements channel
3. Use `!testcrosspost` to test the connection
4. Check bot logs for error messages

### Bot can't react to messages?
- Ensure your Discord bot has "Add Reactions" permission in the updates channel

### Environment variables not loading?
- Make sure your `.env` file is in the same directory as `Main.py`
- Restart the bot after making changes to `.env`

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Keep your bot tokens secure and never share them
- Use environment variables (`.env` file) for sensitive information
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file if using version control
